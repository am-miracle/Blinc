# Strip the local-dev `[patch."…project-blinc/blinc_{canvas_kit,portal_ui,
# node_editor,game_kit}.git"]` block from Cargo.toml.
#
# The committed Cargo.toml never contains this block — the sibling crates
# resolve from their published git pins so a fresh clone builds with no
# setup. `scripts/use-local-packages.sh` appends the block when a dev opts
# into local checkouts under `packages/*` (gitignored); this script is the
# inverse (also exposed as `scripts/use-published-packages.sh`). CI still
# runs it defensively — a no-op on the already-clean committed manifest.
#
# Removes everything from the `# Local-dev redirects for the /packages/*`
# comment marker to EOF, then trims trailing blank lines so repeated
# enable/disable cycles converge on one canonical form. The earlier
# `[patch."…project-blinc/Blinc.git"]` block (redirecting to in-repo
# `crates/*`, present on every clone) is untouched.
#
# Idempotent: safe to run even if the block is already absent.
